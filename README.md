PREDICTION OF GAMEPLAY EFFECT REMOVAL

We finally got some code that handles client-side prediction of Gameplay Effect Removal within the Gameplay Ability System in Unreal Engine. 

This is just an experimental version that allows Gameplay Effect removal via TargetTagsRequirements or RemoveOtherGameplayEffects. We also handle misprediction.

We also support GameplayEffectComponents depending on the FActiveGameplayEffect::EventSet.OnEffectRemoved delegate. Those are : ImmunityGameplayEffectComponent and AdditionalEffectsGameaplayComponent.

So Immunity registers and unregisters queries dynamically and AdditionalEffects adds (and remove if mispredicted) OnRemove-type Gameplay Effects.

There is some adjustements to FActiveGameplayEffect with a new FPredictionKey that is living client side. There are also some changes on how these AGEs replicate (PreReplicatedRemove and PostReplicatedAdd).

Still a work in progress
